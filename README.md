# Busy-Bee

Throw away project (todo tracker website using hand-rolled PHP libraries).

I created this website to test my PSR-7 and router implementations from these repositories (everything seems to work as far as I can see):
- https://github.com/colossalg/Colossal-HTTP-Message
- https://github.com/colossalg/Colossal-Router

As well as to experiment with web-components (I wasn't too happy with how I made use of these, I think I will revisit them in the future).
